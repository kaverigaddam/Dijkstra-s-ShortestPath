My code uses city names instead of numeric indices, making it more relatable to a real-world scenario.
The graph is represented as a "City Network" with a different class name and structure.
The Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented as findShortestRoute with different variable names and slightly different logic.
The main function sets up a network of US cities instead of abstract nodes.
The output gives the shortest distance between two cities.
The output is more descriptive, showing city names and distances in miles.
